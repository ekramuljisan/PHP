<?php
//PHP Strings
// $x = "Ekramul Islam";
// echo $x;

//Double quoted string literals perform operations for special characters:
$x = "Ekramul";
echo "Hello $x \n \t How are you?";


//Single quoted strings does not perform such actions, it returns the string like it was written, with the variable name:
// $x = "Ekramul";
// echo 'Hello $x';
